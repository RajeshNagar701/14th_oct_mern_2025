Responsive :
Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good 
on all devices!

A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different 
screen sizes and viewports.

What is a Media Query?


Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only 
if a certain condition is true(certain Resolution).

Add a Breakpoint
Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.

Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain 
parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.
